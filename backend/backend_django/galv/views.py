Validation schemas contain one or more definitions that describe requirements for Galv objects.
The possible values are available at `/keys/` and should be implemented in your schema thus:

```json
{
    ...
    "$defs": {
        "key_name": {
            ... description
        },
        ... and so on for any other keys
    },
    ...
```

For each of these schemas that is enabled, Galv will test the objects against the definition
by constructing a JSON Schema file that hooks in your definitions and asserts a single object.
This means you need not specify a root object (e.g. with `"type": "object"`) in your schema.

```json
{
    ...
    "type": {"$ref": "#/$defs/key_name"}
}
```

Because your definitions are included locally, you can include references to other definitions in your schema, 
and Galv will automatically resolve them for you.

Galv will highlight any objects that do not meet the requirements.
This can allow you to specify a series of increasingly strict requirements for your lab's metadata.

Schemas are validated against _individually_, and are not checked for consistency.
If you declare that a particular field is a `string` in one schema and a `number` in another, 
Galv will not complain, except to issue a warning for failing to adhere to one or the other schema.

Because schemas validate objects returned from the Galv API, 
schemas should expect most relational fields to be represented as URLs. 

Note: there are some requirements put in place by Galv's database structure. 
These will always apply, and will generate errors rather than warnings.
