Galvanalyser is a system for automatically storing data generated by battery cycling 
machines in a database in a standard format.
The project contains several distinct components:

- A REST API 
  - A Python client for the REST API
  - A web frontend for the REST API
- [Harvesters](https://Battery-Intelligence-Lab.github.io/galvanalyser/UserGuide.html#harvesters) that monitor and process experimental data

A laboratory running a [Galvanalyser server](https://Battery-Intelligence-Lab.github.io/galvanalyser/UserGuide.html#galvanalyser-server) instance and a battery 
cycling machines can use Galvanalyser to make it easy to access, analyse, and 
share their experimental data. 
To do this, they:
1. Set the cycling machines up to output their raw test result files to a shared drive. 
2. Set up a [harvester](https://Battery-Intelligence-Lab.github.io/galvanalyser/UserGuide.html#harvesters) on a computer with access to that shared drive.
    - (This only needs to be done once)
3. Log into their lab [Web frontend](https://Battery-Intelligence-Lab.github.io/galvanalyser/UserGuide.html#web-frontend) and configure the
    [harvester](https://Battery-Intelligence-Lab.github.io/galvanalyser/UserGuide.html#harvesters) to crawl the appropriate directories on the shared drive.
4. Log into the [Web frontend](https://Battery-Intelligence-Lab.github.io/galvanalyser/UserGuide.html#web-frontend) to edit metadata and view data,
    or use the [Python client](https://Battery-Intelligence-Lab.github.io/galvanalyser/UserGuide.html#python-client) to download formatted data for analysis.

The harvesters are able to parse the following file types:

- MACCOR files in .txt, .xsl/.xslx, or raw format
- Ivium files in .idf format
- Biologic files in .mpr format

The server database is a relational database that stores each dataset along with information 
about column types, units, and other relevant metadata (e.g. cell information, owner, purpose 
of the experiment).
The [REST API](https://Battery-Intelligence-Lab.github.io/galvanalyser/UserGuide.html#rest-api) provides its own definition via a downloadable OpenAPI schema file 
(`schema/`), and provides interactive documentation via SwaggerUI (`schema/swagger-ui/`) and
Redoc (`schema/redoc/`).

The schema can be downloaded from the [documentation branch](https://github.com/Battery-Intelligence-Lab/galvanalyser/tree/gh-pages/resources).

A diagram of the logical structure of the system is shown below. The arrows indicate the 
direction of data flow.
